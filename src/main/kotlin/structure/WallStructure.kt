/*
This is the relevant File for the creation of all WallStructures

Structure of this Document
sealed class to allow for save calls in the assetParser
this file contains only documentation of the structures and calls run for each
in the specialStructures Folder the run and relevant Functions are defined via extension Functions

so how do i add a structure
Define the parameters and documentation of the structure here as usual. You dont need to define the parameters already defined in the Wallstructure class
add the run Function in the relevant file in the specialStructures folder You can create Walls with SpookyWall and add them with add(Wall) or add(Collection of walls).
submit a pull request and wait for approval.
